# The Scholarship Project
The Scholarship Projct is Nav's Way to the Massachusetts Institution of Technology, Nav would basically apply for scholarship there in the later years, Nav would code mobile apps, desktop games, computer science project and even hack into FBI... Stay Tuned.
## Project Ideas
1. GitHub + Python3 or Go API, keep a track of your commits.
This is Going to keep a track of my GitHub Commits, I would probably make a mobile app accompanying this idea, the app is going to show basic github data, this is just going to be for personal use, I would publish all of this stuff when I am 16(currently 14).
2. A Simple Hide and Seek Game in C++ and SDL2
The Player Basically has the task to find few objects in a map, the lowest time wins, every object would procedurally rendered. Speedrun Mode or Highest Score Mode?
