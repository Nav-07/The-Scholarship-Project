# Hacking Week: Starting 28 May 2020
This Week I am going to hack my own Go and Python3 Servers using the code I learnt throughout this course, this is going to be longer than one week according to my predictions, let's see.


The Goal for this week is simple.

1. Create the Servers.
2. Get the Secret Data and the Pages.
3. Improve the Current Hacking Tools.
	1. Including the Port Scanner.


This is the plan for the project, hope MIT loves this...
